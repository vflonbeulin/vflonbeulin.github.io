            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of this supervised machine learning project was to develop a predictive maintenance system for vehicles on <b>Dataiku</b>. 
                Using sensor data, we built a model to anticipate potential failures and trigger preventive actions before actual breakdowns occur.
            </p>
                Dataiku allowed efficient data preparation, model training, and evaluation through a collaborative and visual interface (see flow screenshot).
            </p>
            <p>
                The project addressed two key business questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>1. What are the most common factors that lead to vehicle failures ?</li>
                    <li>2. Which vehicles are most likely to experience a breakdown ?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>
                One key advantage of using Dataiku was its <b>no-code interface</b>, which allowed us to focus on what really matters in a machine learning project: 
                data cleaning and model development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform enabled us to perform most tasks — from data preparation to model training — through visual workflows, without having to write complex code. 
                This significantly accelerated our progress and reduced the technical overhead typically associated with machine learning development.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, Dataiku remains highly flexible: when needed, we could seamlessly integrate custom Python scripts into the pipeline. This allowed us to fine-tune specific steps, such as feature engineering or advanced model evaluation.
            </p>
