                Soclia is an <b>AI SaaS solution</b> for legal analysis. It was created in partnership with a notary.
            </p>
            <p>
                My job was mainly on AI, backend and cloud services.
            </p>
            <h3>AI</h3>
                The main goal was to use AI to read and understand legal documents concerning social landlords.
                I used <b>NLP</b> and <b>computer vision</b>, But the first results were not convincing, so i tried using an <b>LLM</b> (Gpt-4o because OpenAI is an azure partner)
                and fine tuned with functions calling.
            <h3>Backend</h3>
            <p>
                I used <b>PostgreSQL</b> for the data and <b>Django Rest Framework</b> for the backend. API is <b>RESTful</b>, We can connect it to any frontend. 
                I worked with a React developer and I gave some ideas for the UI. I've secured endpoints with <b>JWTokens</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suggested moving to Azure for infrastructure, to bring my certifications and Azure cloud architecture experiences to this project.
                I've created several services, including :
                <ul>
                    <li>Azure App Service</li>
                    <li>Azure Storage</li>
                    <li>Azure Database PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Azure Container Registry</li>
                    <li>Azure AI (and Custom Vision)</li>
                    <li>Azure Cache Redis</li>
                    etc... and more
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I used <b>Google Maps API</b> to geolocate the addresses building of landlords. We used OpenStreetMap to display this information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is containerized with Docker and push to a private registry.
            </p>
            <h3>Success</h3>
